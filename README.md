# PYTHON_Analysis_CO2_countries
In this project, we were provided with a dataset containing CO2 production data categorized by country. With limited initial information about the dataset, our primary mission was to embark on an exploratory journey. Our first objective was to explore the dataset to gain insights into its structure, patterns and trends that lay within the data.
